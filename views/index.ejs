        Let's include the Vue.js framework. 
        We'll use this just a little bit, to display the chat log.
        Just a nice way to get our toes wet without diving into a Vue.js tutorial, too.

            Let's include our nonnychat JavaScript and CSS files.
            Note that these are in that public folder that can be accessed directly by URL
            This is why we did that... now we can just link to them the normal way as below:
        -->
        <script src="/public/main.js"></script>
        <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="/public/main.css" />

                Tap Repeatedly!
